# DAG Jobs

A flexible, lightweight framework for managing and processing Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG)-based jobs.

This package provides core abstractions and utilities to define jobs with dependencies, track their execution status, and orchestrate their processing in a reliable, dependency-aware manner.

Ideal for building distributed task runners, workflow engines, or any system where jobs depend on the completion of other jobs before execution.
