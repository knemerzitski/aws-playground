# Math Expression Jobs

A domain-specific extension of the DAG Jobs framework to compute mathematical expressions as jobs.

This package defines job types and handlers for basic math operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division), enabling distributed and incremental evaluation of complex math expressions using DAG job processing.

Perfect for systems that require safe, composable, and asynchronous computation of math expressions with dependency tracking.
